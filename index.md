# What is TLS?

The TLS protocols allows client/server applications to communicate over the
Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and
message forgery.  TLS is the connection oriented verions and DTLS is the
connectionless variant; (D)TLS is often used to refer to both protocols.

See [our charter](http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tls/charter/) for more
details of the scope of the work.  Additionally, you can also check our
[Frequently Asked Questions](/faq/).

# Specifications

TLS has been revised a number of times, but the current specifications are:

* [TLS1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/)
* [DTLS1.3](https://github.com/ekr/dtls13-spec) (not yet adopted by the WG)

# Implementations

We track [known
implementations](https://github.com/tlswg/tls13-spec/wiki/Implementations) of
TLS and DTLS 1.3 on our wiki.
