# What is TLS?

The TLS protocols allows client/server applications to communicate over the
Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and
message forgery.  TLS is the connection-oriented verions and DTLS is the
connectionless-oriented variant; (D)TLS is used to refer to both protocols.

See [our charter](http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tls/charter/) for more
details of the scope of the work.  Additionally, you can also check our
[Frequently Asked Questions](/faq/).

# Working Specifications

TLS has been revised a number of times, but the current specifications
we are working on are:

* [TLS1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/)
* [DTLS1.3](datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-dtls13/)
* [TLS 1.3 Test Vectors](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13-vectors/)
* [TLS 1.3 Certificate Compression](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-certificate-compression/)
* [DTLS Connection IDs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id/)
* [Server Name Indication Encryption](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption/)
* [Delegated Credentials](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-subcerts/)
* [Exported Authenticators](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-exported-authenticator/)


# Older Specifications

The previous versions of TLS and DTLS can be found at:

* [TLS 1.2] (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246)
* [DTLS 1.2] (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)

# Implementations

We track [known
implementations](https://github.com/tlsdoc13-spec/wiki/Implementations) of
TLS and DTLS 1.3 on our wiki.
